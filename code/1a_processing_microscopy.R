#### Processing microscopy data

## This code processes microscopy data from the EDI data release 
## (averaging across slides and evaluting rsd), remove non-algal portion
## and recalculates relative abundance

#### (1) Loading in libraries & data ####

# loading libraries
lapply(c("tidyverse", "lubridate"), require, character.only = T)

# read in microscopy data
target <- read.csv("./data/EDI_data_package/microscopy_target_samples.csv")
nontarget <- read.csv("./data/EDI_data_package/microscopy_non_target_samples.csv")

#### (2) Analyzing microscopy data (w/ multiple slides) ####

## (a) target samples

# look at average, sd, & rsd for each taxa across slides
target_multislides <- target %>% 
  filter(slide_rep != "Final") %>% 
  pivot_longer(microcoleus:aphanothece, names_to = "taxa", values_to = "percent") %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(taxa, site_reach, field_date, sample_type) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean = mean(percent),
                   sd = sd(percent),
                   rsd = (sd * 100) / mean)
view(target_multislides) # the highest are all samples where one slide had 0.1% cover
mean(target_multislides$rsd, na.rm = TRUE) # 44.3% high but let's look at taxa 
                                           # that have >5% mean cover
plot(target_multislides$mean, target_multislides$rsd)
# yup, samples with a higher mean have a lower rsd

# looking at taxa that have >5% mean cover
target_multislides_sub <- target_multislides %>% 
  filter(mean > 5)
view(target_multislides_sub)
mean(target_multislides_sub$rsd) # 21.7% high but better

# pivot back wider to join back into processed
target_multislides_wider <- target_multislides %>% 
  select(!(sd:rsd)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "taxa", values_from = "mean")

# for data that were already averaged across three slides,
# we need to match it up to the processed data frame
target_processed <- target %>% 
  filter(slide_rep == "Final") %>% 
  select(!(slide_rep:method)) # remove columns we don't need

# match up column order
target_processed <- target_processed[,colnames(target_multislides_wider)]

# rbind to join dataframes
target_processed <- rbind(target_processed, target_multislides_wider)

## (b) non-target samples

# look at average, sd, & rsd for each taxa across slides
# no samples here are averaged over as indicated by "Final"
nontarget_multislides <- nontarget %>% 
  pivot_longer(non_algal:unknown, names_to = "taxa", values_to = "percent") %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(taxa, site_reach, field_date, sample_type) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean = mean(percent),
                   sd = sd(percent),
                   rsd = (sd * 100) / mean)
view(nontarget_multislides) # the highest are all samples where one slide had 0.1% cover
mean(nontarget_multislides$rsd, na.rm = TRUE) # 97.6% high but let's look at taxa 
                                              # that have >5% mean cover
plot(nontarget_multislides$mean, nontarget_multislides$rsd)
# less strong of a relationship with non-target samples

# looking at taxa that have >5% mean cover
nontarget_multislides_sub <- nontarget_multislides %>% 
  filter(mean > 5)
view(nontarget_multislides_sub)
mean(nontarget_multislides_sub$rsd) # 42.8% high but better

# pivot back wider to join with anatoxin and environmental data
nt_processed <- nontarget_multislides %>% 
  select(!(sd:rsd)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "taxa", values_from = "mean") 

# confirm that everything sums up to 100
check_nt <- which(rowSums(nt_processed[4:ncol(nt_processed)]) != 100)
check_t <- which(rowSums(target_processed[4:ncol(target_processed)]) != 100)

# check these values- maybe slight variations in float?
# like minor issues when averaging such small decimals across multiple slides
rowSums(target_processed[4:ncol(target_processed)])[check_t] # is 100
rowSums(nt_processed[4:ncol(nt_processed)])[check_nt] # most are 100
# but for the few that aren't (52, 58, 60) which are 99.975, 99.975, 99.980, we will just add 
# the remainder to the dominant taxa in that sample
nt_processed[52,]$spirogyra <- nt_processed[52,]$spirogyra + (100 - 99.975)
nt_processed[58,]$spirogyra <- nt_processed[58,]$spirogyra + (100 - 99.975)
nt_processed[60,]$cladophora <- nt_processed[60,]$cladophora + (100 - 99.980)

# run through check and rowSums code again to make sure they are all now 100 in appearance

#### (3) Remove non-algal portion from relative abundance & recalculate ####

# function to remove non-algal portion and recalculate
remove_non_algal <- function(df) {
  # remove non-algal portion
  temp_df <- df %>% 
    select(!non_algal)
  
  # calculate total percent abundance of algal portion
  temp_df$total_algal_percent <- rowSums(temp_df[c(4:ncol(temp_df))]) # hard-coded; always have 4 info columns
  
  
  # pivot longer for easy re-calculation and then pivot back wider
  final_df <- temp_df %>% 
    relocate(total_algal_percent, .after = sample_type) %>%  # quick reorganization
    pivot_longer(cols = c(5:ncol(temp_df)), values_to = "old_percent", names_to = "taxa") %>% 
    mutate(new_percent = (old_percent / total_algal_percent) * 100) %>% 
    select(!c(old_percent, total_algal_percent)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = "taxa", values_from = "new_percent")
  
  # return final dataframe
  return(final_df)
}

# apply function to dataframes
nt_processed2 <- remove_non_algal(nt_processed)
target_processed2 <- remove_non_algal(target_processed)

# double check that all recalculated taxa columns sum to 100!
check_nt2 <- which(rowSums(nt_processed2[4:ncol(nt_processed2)]) != 100)
check_t2 <- which(rowSums(target_processed2[4:ncol(target_processed2)]) != 100)

# check these values- again likely minor decimal issues 
# as computers are bad at dealing with small numbers
rowSums(target_processed2[4:ncol(target_processed2)])[check_t2] # all are 100
rowSums(nt_processed2[4:ncol(nt_processed2)])[check_nt2] # all are 100

#### (3) Final edits to match environmental covariate data ####

# separate out TAC and TM 
tm_processed2 <- target_processed2 %>% 
 filter(sample_type == "TM")
tac_processed2 <- target_processed2 %>% 
  filter(sample_type == "TAC")

# change label on 9/8/2022 sample to 9/6/2022
# (substitute technician accidentally took 2022-09-06 with different methods, not in this dataset)
tm_processed2$field_date[which(tm_processed2$field_date == "2022-09-08")] <- "2022-09-06"

# put all processed data into a list
processed <- list(tm_processed2, tac_processed2, nt_processed2)
names(processed) <- c("tm", "tac", "nt")

# make a column for the site name
processed <- lapply(processed, function(x) x %>% 
                      mutate(site = case_when(grepl("RUS", site_reach) ~ "RUS",
                                              grepl("SFE-M", site_reach) ~ "SFE-M",
                                              grepl("SAL", site_reach) ~ "SAL",
                                              grepl("SFE-SH", site_reach) ~ "SFE-SH")) %>% 
                      relocate(site, .before = "site_reach"))

# turns out we don't have ATX data for TM SFE-M-4 08-23-2022
# I think we weren't clear if it would be Microcoleus and did not have enough
# so let's just remove that row
processed$tm <- processed$tm[-22,]

# saving csv's
path <- paste(getwd(), "/data/morphological/", sep = "")
lapply(names(processed), function(x) write.csv(processed[[x]], file = paste(path, x, "_algalonly.csv", 
                                                                              sep = ""), row.names = FALSE))
