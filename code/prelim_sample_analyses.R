#### Assigning sample names and types to sequence reads
### 9.4.2024

# NOTE: our "unknown" IDs from the plates are 108*, 801, 552, 554, and 931 
# *there were 2 108s divided into 1000 and 1001
# our "unknown" IDs from the sample metadata are 104, 115, 208, ??, ??
# ?? are probably numbers > 500 and are unafiliated with this project

# characteristics of unknown sample IDs:
# 104 - Russian River, non-targeted/community composition (8/17/2022)
# 115 - Russian River, targeted-anabaena/cylindrospermum (9/1/2022)
# 208 - Russian River, non-targeted/community composition (9/15/2022)
# ??? - Microcoleus rock from South Fork Eel (for another project) (SFE-M-1S, 9/8/22)
# ??? - Control rock (green algae) from South Fork Eel (for another project) (SFE-M-1S, 9/8/22)

# the known 108 is a RUS-3 fake TM from 8/17/2022

# also have sample 27 which we were unsure if it was Microcoleus or not
# (though I don't think it has a corresponding anatoxin concentration measurement bc sample was so small anyways)

# OKAY- looked at my emails- Anabaena was recently separated into 
# Dolichiospermum (planktonic) and Trichormus (benthic) so for our purposes

# early season sample is more mixed which makes sense
